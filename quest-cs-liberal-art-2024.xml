seems urgent to me, a senior math-CS major at Reed, as our young department
seeks to establish its place in the college at large and as it struggles within
itself over the nature of its subject. I think that many of the concerns about
the role of computer science stem from misunderstandings over its nature, both
as a subject and as taught at Reed. Computer science, as practiced at Reed and
throughout the academy, is not solely vocational training but is additionally an
essential intellectual pursuit with broad applications to humanistic inquiry.</fr:p><fr:p>A rough definition: computer science is something like <fr:em>the study of
computation</fr:em>. Computations—algorithmic processes for solving problems—are likely
as old as thought; their structure has been studied at least since the invention
of the abacus in Sumer in the third millennium BCE. Computer science, in this
sense, cannot be understood merely as the study of computers, as in the literal
physical devices we all use every day. Instead, it is the study of the very idea
of mechanistic problem-solving. Modern computers are an important example of
such tools, so inevitably feature centrally in the discipline as both method and
object, but the stakes of the discipline must be understood as far older. Of
course, as with all academic disciplines, its modern borders are historically
contingent—computer science is entangled with mathematics and philosophy, with
physics and linguistics, with sociology and political science. Any field with
something to say about computers, the artifacts; or computation, the process; or
which uses computers or computations as tools for studying its own objects,
ought to be a natural ally.</fr:p><fr:p>Indeed, the study of computation addresses numerous fundamental, humanistic
inquiries. In CS 382 (Algorithms and Data Structures) and 387 (Computability and
Complexity), we discuss which questions can possibly be answered by rote
computation—and by contrast, which questions require genuine creative thought.
In CS 315 (Ethics and Public Policy) and 386 (Private and Fair Data Analysis),
we question the role of computer technology and algorithmic decision-making in
society, asking when the state ought to act with discretion and when it ought to
act by mere procedure. In CS 378 (Deep Learning), 384 (Programming Language
Design and Implementation), and 394 (Principles of Compiler Design), we study
different means of representing processes of computation, and hence processes of
thought—and the limits that any such translation must inevitably have. I think
no one would doubt that these questions and many more like them have a place in
the liberal arts.</fr:p><fr:p>In the <fr:em>Republic</fr:em>, Plato says that education should be "the art of
orientation"—aimed not to impart knowledge onto students, but to orient them so
that they can seek knowledge for themselves. By this standard, too, computer
science has a clear place in the liberal arts. At its best, it teaches us to
precisely communicate our thoughts and arguments, to reason rigorously and
creatively about deep questions, and to critically evaluate tradeoffs between
conflicting arguments or design choices. At times we are able to work with
mathematical precision, and at times we have to make subjective or even
philosophical judgments. That the methods of the field are so varied is evidence
of the naturality of its object: questions about computation reward you for
studying them from different perspectives, with as many tools as you can muster.</fr:p><fr:p>In this light, we must understand that computer science is not just coding or
software engineering. Certainly, coding is one of the central tools of the
discipline—analogous to the role of ethnography in anthropology, or primary
source analysis in history. It is a tool we use to express computational
patterns, either to specify how a computer should behave or to communicate our
ideas precisely to other computer scientists. Many computer scientists spend
much of their time coding, but so too do many anthropologists spend much of
their time performing fieldwork. I do not mean to denigrate the importance of
coding to the discipline—computer science is enormously valuable for software
engineers, in the same way that anthropology is valuable for journalists—but
software engineering is not its <fr:em>raison d'etre</fr:em>.</fr:p><fr:p>Computation is as natural an object of study as matter, or life, or politics,
or literature; the methods of computer science are as valuable as those of
chemistry, or biology, or political science, or English. Ada Lovelace, the
author of the first modern computer program and hence one of the originators of
the modern discipline of computer science, wrote that "the Analytical Engine
weaves algebraical patterns just as the Jacquard loom weaves flowers and
leaves". Computer science is nothing more or less than the study of the weaving
of such patterns.</fr:p></fr:mainmatter><fr:backmatter /></fr:tree>
